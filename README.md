# Python exercise
 
In this exercise the goal was to get familiar with Python. How to create a class with a constructor and with some methods, how to inherit a class, how does the tkinter work etc.

As a part of this exercise a simple program was made where a txt file is loaded and the specific coordinates are taken. Then using the keyword (<i>Linija</i>, <i>Pravokutnik</i> ...) a specific shape is drawn using the coordinates from the txt file. 
Every shape has a class (in the pdf file classes are show on the last page.
